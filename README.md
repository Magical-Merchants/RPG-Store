This project was originally a group project for the senior phase of Grace Hopper at Fullstack Academy.

I am now revisiting the project.

These are the intentions:
- refactor code base to use redux toolkit and react hooks
- improve security
- pagination
- filtering
- search
- bootstrap? / some sort of styling framework
- guest cart will convert to a user's cart when they log in.
- different landing page - sliding banner?
